This is the Techy Blinders' Voiceflow Project! (ft. Berke Altiparmak, Chenika Bukes, Krishna Cheemalapati, Dhairya Khara, Aidan Li)

## Getting Started
- Install MongoDB and NodeJS
- Clone the repo
- Start MongoDB on port 27017 (the default MongoDB port)
- To start the client run `cd client`, `npm install`, `npm run start` from the root of the project.
- To start the server run `cd server`, `npm install`, `npm run start` from the root of the project. Note, if you have `nodemon` installed, you can also run `npm run dev` instead of `npm run start` for a better development experience.

If everything is done correctly, you can visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your favourite browser to start using the Application.
